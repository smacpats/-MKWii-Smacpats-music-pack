Smacpats’ Music pack, beta 1


For dolphin or an ISO image, copy all the BRSTM files (everything inside of the “BRSTM files” folder, into /files/Race/Course and recompile your ISO.



For CTGP Revolution 1.0.3 on a real wii, copy all of the BRSTM files into the folder named “My Stuff” inside your CTGPR folder on your SD card. If the folder does not exist,
create it. Make sure that “My stuff” is enabled in the CTGP options menu before starting your game.


If you have any questions or want help, message me on Twitter @Smacpats, or on reddit /u/Smacpats111111.


This version of the pack is extreme early beta. Some music may be broken.
I will do much more actual testing before even calling this an Release candidate.
